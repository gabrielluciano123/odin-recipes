    <h4>Description</h4>

    <P></P>

    <P>Chicken burgers are notoriously dry, but not anymore! Adding minced roasted mushrooms to ground chicken not only adds extra moisture, it gives a deep umami flavor that even beef lovers will drool over. </P>

    <H4>INGREDIENTS</H4>

    <UL>
        <li>3/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 small carrot, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>1/4 large English cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>1/4 small red onion, cut into 1/8-inch thick wedges</li>
    </UL>
    <p></p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together 3/4 cups rice vinegar, water, sugar, and sesame seeds in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add carrot, cucumber, and red onion, separating onion layers; toss to coat. Chill until ready to use, stirring occasionally to keep vegetables submerged in the brine.</li>
        <li>Whisk together mayonnaise, Thai sweet chile sauce, Sriracha, 1 teaspoon rice vinegar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Chill Bang Bang Sauce until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Broil vegetables until charred, turning halfway through, about 10 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Brush skillet with 1 teaspoon oil and toast brioche buns, cut side down, until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes; set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread a light layer of Bang Bang sauce on bottom buns. Add 2 charred jalape√±o halves per bun. Add chicken patty and top with slaw and charred scallions. Top with cilantro and drizzle with more sauce.</li>
    </ol>
